\section{General Information}

\subsection{Purpose}
	This document is an outline of the procedures intended to be used to verify 
	that the software project currently under development, Q-aRt Code satisfies 
	requirements as specified in the SRS document. This plan and the majority 
	of the tests described within have been constructed prior to the completion 
	of the project implementation. As such, the intention of the document is to 
	be used as a reference during the implementation of the software, and 
	during testing.
\subsection{Scope}
	The majority of the project is encoding binary strings from the input data, 
	therefore, the scope of the testing for this software will largely be 
	ensuring correctness of these generated strings, but also includes 
	readability of the final generated QR code, as well as image quality.

\subsection{Overview of Document}

\section{Plan}
	
\subsection{Software Description}
	The software under development for this project, Q-aRt Code, is a QR code 
	generator that has the added functionality of creating artistic QR codes. 
	The modular decomposition of the software is as follows:
	\begin{itemize}  
		\item Encode binary strings from the input data .
		\item Generate error correction codewords from the binary strings.
		\item Structure data and error correction binary strings, including 
		interleaving.
		\item Create a matrix using the generated data according to QR code 
		standards.
		\item Combine generated QR Code with input image to create artistic QR 
		code.
	\end{itemize}
\subsection{Test Team}
	Each member of the test team will be responsible for both the creation of 
	tests and their execution. The members of the test team are as follows:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Elton Schiott
		\item Emilio Hajj
		\item Liam Duncan
	\end{itemize}
\subsection{Automated Testing Approach}

\subsection{Testing Tools}
	Unit testing will be conducted using the Python unittest unit testing 
	framework.

\section{System Test Description}
	
\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\subsubsection{Functionality and Fidelity of QR Encoder}
		
\paragraph{QR Scanning App}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{Retrieve URL\\}

Type: Functional, Dynamic.
					
Initial State: Output on hand.
					
Input: Display/View of QR Code png.
					
Output: Originally encoded URL.
					
How test will be performed: With a QR Scanning Application.
					
\item{Max. Character URL Retrieval \\}

Type: Functional, Dynamic.
			
Initial State: Output on hand.
					
Input: Display/View of QR Code png.
					
Output: Originally encoded URL with the maximum number of character.  
					
How test will be performed: With a QR Scanning Application.


\item{Empty String\\}

Type: Functional, Dynamic.
					
Initial State: Output on hand.
					
Input: Display/View of QR Code png. 
					
Output: No Output, displays "Empty String" message.
					
How test will be performed: With a QR Scanning Application.


\item{URL with greater than max. characters\\}

Type: Functional, Dynamic.
					
Initial State: Output on hand.
					
Input: Display/View of QR Code png, \#808080 grey square image.
					
Output: No Output, displays error message.
					
How test will be performed: With a QR Scanning Application.

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Input Handling}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{ASCII not compatible with URL\\}

Type: Functional, Dynamic.
					
Initial State: Start GUI.
					
Input: Characters in GUI text box, no image.
					
Output: No Output, displays error message.
					
How test will be performed: Pressing "Create" in start GUI.

\item{Attempt to paste chars not within the accepted range: in this case Kanji, which the system will not handle\\}

Type: Functional, Dynamic.
					
Initial State: Start GUI.
					
Input: Characters in GUI text box, no image.
					
Output: No Output, displays error message.
					
How test will be performed: Pressing "Create" in start GUI.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\subsubsection{Aesthetic Tests}
		
\paragraph{Title for Test}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{Colour Fidelity\\}

Type: Non-Functional, Dynamic.
					
Initial State: Start GUI.
					
Input/Condition: Standard URL, unspecific single colour square image.
					
Output/Result: QR code with much of its content the same colour as the square image.
					
How test will be performed: An on-screen hex eyedrop tool will be used to compare the input colour image with elements of the output image.
					
\item{Visual Text Legibility\\}

Type: Non-Functional, Dynamic, Manual.
					
Initial State: Output on hand.
					
Input: Display/View of QR Code png, square image of some text.
					
Output: QR code with "artistic" text appearance.
					
How test will be performed: Member visually inspects output PNG with text chosen by another member, writes down the text they see and compares it to entered text.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Appendix}

This is where you can place additional information.

\subsection{Symbolic Parameters}

The definition of the test cases will call for SYMBOLIC\_CONSTANTS.
Their values are defined in this section for easy maintenance.

\subsection{Usability Survey Questions?}

This is a section that would be appropriate for some teams.
